In this Project, we will predict Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Python. This is a Regression Machine Learning Project. Okay so let's try to understand how we are going to do this. First, let us see the workflow of this project.
1.	Firstly, we collect Car Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about used cars. 
2.	Then we need to pre-process the data because we cannot feed this raw data to our machine learning algorithm.
3.	So once we process the data we will split this data into training data and testing data.
4.	Our aim is to predict two machine learning models with the linear regression and the lasso regression model. We will compare the accuracy score or the error percentage of these models and see which model performs better.
